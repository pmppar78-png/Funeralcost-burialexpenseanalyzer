            I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I’m an AI helper that can talk with you about funeral and burial
            costs, what usually affects the price, and questions you might want to ask funeral homes or other
            professionals.
          </p>
          <p class="message-small">
            I cannot give financial, legal, tax, medical, or funeral-director advice, and I cannot tell you what to
            sign or which option you personally should choose. My role is to explain things in plain language and help
            you feel more prepared for conversations with licensed professionals and trusted advisors.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it would help, I can also point you toward planning and consumer education resources such as the Funeral
            Consumers Alliance (https://www.funerals.org), Parting.com (https://www.parting.com), Ever Loved
            (https://everloved.com), or Dignity Memorial (https://www.dignitymemorial.com) so you can explore them on
            your own time.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you’re ready, tell me a little about what you’re facing — for example, a quote you received, your
            approximate budget, or the kind of service you’re hoping for — and we can think through it together.
