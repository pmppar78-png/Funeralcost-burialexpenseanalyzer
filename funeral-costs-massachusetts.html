      <h2 id="cost-factors">What Drives Funeral Costs in Massachusetts</h2>
      <p>Funeral costs in Massachusetts are influenced by several factors. The Northeast region of the United States tends to have higher-than-average funeral costs compared to the national median of $7,848. Within Massachusetts, you will find significant price differences between urban and rural areas, with metropolitan areas generally costing 10% to 30% more than small towns.</p>
      <p>The cost of living in Massachusetts, local competition among funeral providers, state regulations, cultural traditions, and real estate prices all play a role in determining what families pay. The cremation rate of 58% in Massachusetts also affects the market — areas with higher cremation rates often see more competitive pricing for cremation services.</p>

      <h2 id="cities">Major Cities in Massachusetts</h2>
      <p>Funeral costs vary across Massachusetts's major metropolitan areas. Urban centers typically have higher overhead costs, which are reflected in funeral pricing. Here are the major cities in Massachusetts:</p>
