      <h2>Understanding Sacramento Funeral Pricing</h2>
      <p>Funeral costs in Sacramento carry a metro premium of approximately 15% above the California state average. This is driven by higher real estate costs for funeral home facilities, higher labor costs, and greater demand for services in a dense metropolitan area. However, the competitive market in Sacramento also means you have more providers to choose from, which gives you leverage when comparing prices.</p>
      <p>The most effective way to find the best price is to request General Price Lists from 2 to 3 funeral homes in the Sacramento area and compare them line by line. Under the FTC Funeral Rule, every provider must give you this list upon request — no appointment needed, no commitment required.</p>
      
      <h2>Compare: Sacramento vs. Other California Cities</h2>
      <p>Funeral costs can vary significantly even within California. Here is how Sacramento compares to other metro areas in the state:</p>
      <div class="cost-table-wrap">
        <table class="cost-table">
          <caption>Funeral Cost Comparison in California (2026)</caption>
          <thead><tr><th>City</th><th>Traditional Funeral</th><th>Direct Cremation</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>Sacramento</strong></td><td><strong>$12,190</strong></td><td><strong>$2,530</strong></td></tr>
            <tr><td><a href="funeral-costs-los-angeles.html">Los Angeles</a></td><td>$13,250</td><td>$2,750</td></tr>
            <tr><td><a href="funeral-costs-san-diego.html">San Diego</a></td><td>$12,720</td><td>$2,640</td></tr>
            <tr><td><a href="funeral-costs-san-jose.html">San Jose</a></td><td>$13,780</td><td>$2,860</td></tr>
            <tr><td><a href="funeral-costs-california.html">California Average</a></td><td>$10,600</td><td>$2,200</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>At $12,190, Sacramento runs about 15% above the California state average of $10,600. This premium reflects Sacramento's higher cost of living, real estate, and provider overhead. Regardless of location, comparing at least 2-3 providers before committing can save families $1,000 or more.</p>
