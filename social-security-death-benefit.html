      <p class="guide-intro">
        When a loved one passes away, the Social Security Administration (SSA) offers a one-time lump-sum death benefit of $255 to eligible survivors. While the amount is modest, it is money you are entitled to claim, and understanding the process can help you avoid missing the filing deadline. This guide explains who qualifies, how to apply, what documents you need, and what additional survivor benefits may be available to your family.
      </p>

      <!-- What Is the Social Security Death Benefit? -->
      <h2 id="what-is-it">What Is the Social Security Death Benefit?</h2>
      <p>
        The Social Security lump-sum death benefit (LSDB) is a one-time payment of $255 made to the surviving spouse or dependent child of a deceased worker who had earned enough Social Security work credits. The payment was originally established by the Social Security Act Amendments of 1954, when it was intended to help cover basic burial expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite decades of inflation, the $255 amount has never been increased. In 1954, $255 had the purchasing power of roughly $2,900 in today's dollars, making it a meaningful contribution toward funeral costs at the time. Today, it covers only a small fraction of the national median funeral cost, which exceeds $7,800 according to the National Funeral Directors Association. Still, it remains a benefit that eligible families should claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to note that this is not an automatic payment. Someone must apply for the benefit, and there is a strict two-year filing deadline from the date of death.
      </p>

      <!-- Who Qualifies for the Death Benefit? -->
      <h2 id="who-qualifies">Who Qualifies for the Death Benefit?</h2>
      <p>
        Not everyone is eligible to receive the $255 lump-sum death benefit. The SSA has specific rules about who can claim it and what the deceased worker must have contributed during their lifetime.
      </p>
      <h3>Eligible survivors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Surviving spouse</strong> who was living with the deceased at the time of death.</li>
        <li><strong>Surviving spouse</strong> who was living apart but was eligible for Social Security benefits on the deceased's record in the month of death.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependent child</strong> of the deceased, if there is no eligible surviving spouse. The child must have been eligible for benefits on the deceased's record in the month of death.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Work credits required</h3>
      <p>
        The deceased must have earned enough Social Security work credits during their lifetime. In general, this means 40 credits (approximately 10 years of work). However, younger workers who die before accumulating 40 credits may still qualify if they earned at least six credits in the three years before death. In 2026, one credit is earned for every $1,810 in wages or self-employment income, with a maximum of four credits per year.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the deceased never worked or did not earn enough credits, the lump-sum death benefit is not available. Similarly, the payment cannot be made to a funeral home, a friend, or an extended family member who is not a spouse or dependent child.
      </p>

      <!-- How to Apply for the Death Benefit -->
      <h2 id="how-to-apply">How to Apply for the Death Benefit</h2>
      <p>
        Claiming the $255 death benefit requires contacting the Social Security Administration directly. Here is the step-by-step process:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Report the death to the SSA.</strong> In many cases, the funeral home will report the death to Social Security if you provide the deceased's Social Security number. However, this does not automatically trigger a payment of the lump-sum benefit. You must still apply separately.</li>
        <li><strong>Call the SSA at 1-800-772-1213</strong> (TTY 1-800-325-0778) to begin the application process. Representatives are available Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. local time. You can also visit your local Social Security office in person.</li>
        <li><strong>Complete the application.</strong> The SSA representative will guide you through the necessary questions and let you know which documents to provide. In some cases, you may be able to complete the application by phone; in others, an office visit may be required.</li>
        <li><strong>Submit required documents.</strong> Provide certified copies of the death certificate and other supporting documents (see the next section for a complete list).</li>
        <li><strong>Wait for processing.</strong> Once your application is submitted, the SSA will review it and issue payment. Processing times vary, but payments typically arrive within a few weeks to a few months.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Remember: the filing deadline is <strong>two years from the date of death</strong>. If you miss this deadline, the benefit is permanently forfeited.
      </p>

      <!-- Documents You'll Need -->
      <h2 id="documents-needed">Documents You'll Need</h2>
      <p>
        When applying for the lump-sum death benefit, gather the following documents in advance to make the process as smooth as possible:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Certified copy of the death certificate.</strong> Most SSA offices require an original or certified copy, not a photocopy.</li>
        <li><strong>Deceased's Social Security number.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Your Social Security number</strong> (the applicant's).</li>
        <li><strong>Marriage certificate</strong> if you are the surviving spouse.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof of citizenship or lawful residency</strong> if applicable.</li>
        <li><strong>Birth certificate of a dependent child</strong> if the child is the applicant.</li>
        <li><strong>Bank account information</strong> for direct deposit of the payment (optional but speeds up delivery).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The SSA uses original or certified documents only and will return them after review. If you are missing any documents, contact the SSA to ask about alternative forms of proof they may accept.
      </p>

        While the $255 lump-sum payment is a one-time benefit, Social Security also provides ongoing monthly survivor benefits that can be far more substantial. These monthly payments are based on the deceased worker's earnings record and can provide critical financial support.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Surviving spouse age 60 or older:</strong> May receive reduced survivor benefits. Full benefits are available at the surviving spouse's full retirement age.</li>
        <li><strong>Surviving spouse age 50-59 with a disability:</strong> May receive reduced survivor benefits.</li>
        <li><strong>Surviving spouse at any age caring for a child under 16:</strong> May receive up to 75% of the deceased's benefit amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Unmarried children under 18 (or up to 19 if still in high school):</strong> May receive up to 75% of the deceased's benefit amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Disabled adult children:</strong> A child disabled before age 22 may receive benefits on the deceased parent's record.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependent parents age 62 or older:</strong> May receive benefits if they were receiving at least half their financial support from the deceased worker.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A divorced surviving spouse may also be eligible for monthly survivor benefits if the marriage lasted at least 10 years. These monthly benefits should be discussed with the SSA, as they can amount to hundreds or even thousands of dollars per month depending on the deceased's earnings history.
      </p>

      <!-- Common Mistakes to Avoid -->
      <h2 id="common-mistakes">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <p>
        Families navigating the aftermath of a death have many responsibilities to manage at once. Here are common mistakes that can cost you the death benefit or delay survivor benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Missing the two-year deadline.</strong> This is the most common reason families lose the $255 benefit. Mark the deadline on your calendar and apply as soon as you can.</li>
        <li><strong>Assuming the funeral home handles everything.</strong> While the funeral home may report the death to the SSA, they do not file the lump-sum death benefit application on your behalf. You must apply separately.</li>
        <li><strong>Not reporting the death promptly.</strong> Social Security benefits paid to the deceased after the month of death must be returned. If the deceased was receiving monthly benefits, notify the SSA immediately to avoid overpayments and potential repayment demands.</li>
        <li><strong>Overlooking monthly survivor benefits.</strong> Many families claim only the $255 payment without realizing they may qualify for ongoing monthly benefits that are far more valuable.</li>
        <li><strong>Discarding important documents.</strong> Keep multiple certified copies of the death certificate. You will need them for Social Security, life insurance claims, bank accounts, and other purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Not checking the deceased's earnings record.</strong> If the deceased's earnings record has errors, it could affect both the lump-sum benefit and monthly survivor benefits. You can request a review from the SSA.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Other Government Benefits After a Death -->
      <h2 id="other-benefits">Other Government Benefits After a Death</h2>
      <p>
        The Social Security death benefit is just one of several government programs that may provide financial assistance after a death. Depending on the deceased's background and your circumstances, you may also be eligible for the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Veterans burial benefits:</strong> The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides burial allowances, free burial in national cemeteries, headstones, and flags for eligible veterans. Benefits can range from a government-furnished headstone to several thousand dollars toward burial and funeral costs. See our <a href="veteran-burial-benefits.html">veteran burial benefits guide</a> for details.</li>
        <li><strong>FEMA funeral assistance:</strong> If the death was related to a federally declared disaster (such as COVID-19), FEMA may reimburse up to $9,000 or more in funeral expenses.</li>
        <li><strong>State and county burial assistance:</strong> Many states offer indigent burial programs or emergency assistance for families who cannot afford funeral costs. Eligibility varies widely by location. See our <a href="funeral-payment-assistance.html">funeral payment assistance guide</a> for more information.</li>
        <li><strong>Workers' compensation death benefits:</strong> If the death was work-related, the family may be entitled to funeral expense reimbursement and ongoing survivor benefits through the employer's workers' compensation insurance.</li>
        <li><strong>Federal employee benefits:</strong> Surviving family members of federal employees or retirees may be eligible for lump-sum payments, annuity survivor benefits, and other programs through the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- How the Death Benefit Fits Into Funeral Planning -->
      <h2 id="funeral-planning">How the Death Benefit Fits Into Funeral Planning</h2>
      <p>
        It is important to have realistic expectations about the Social Security death benefit. At $255, the payment covers only a tiny fraction of average funeral expenses. The national median cost for a funeral with burial is approximately $7,848, and even the most affordable option, direct cremation, typically costs $1,000 to $3,500.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of the $255 benefit as one small piece of a larger financial picture. Families who need help covering funeral costs should explore all available options, including life insurance proceeds, veterans benefits, state assistance programs, community and faith-based support, crowdfunding, and payment plans offered by funeral homes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are planning ahead, pre-need funeral arrangements can lock in current pricing, and payable-on-death bank accounts can ensure designated funds are available immediately after a death without going through probate. Our <a href="cheap-funeral-options.html">affordable funeral options guide</a> and <a href="direct-cremation-cost.html">direct cremation cost guide</a> offer additional strategies for keeping costs manageable while still honoring your loved one with dignity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above all, do not let the modest size of the $255 benefit deter you from applying. Every dollar matters during a difficult time, and the process of contacting the SSA also opens the door to learning about monthly survivor benefits that may be far more significant.

            <summary class="faq-question">How much is the Social Security death benefit in 2026?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The Social Security lump-sum death benefit is a one-time payment of $255. This amount has not changed since 1954 and is not adjusted for inflation. It remains the same regardless of the deceased's earnings history or the survivor's financial situation.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary class="faq-question">Who is eligible to receive the $255 death benefit?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The benefit can be paid to a surviving spouse who was living with the deceased at the time of death, or a surviving spouse who was eligible for Social Security benefits on the deceased's record. If there is no eligible spouse, a dependent child of the deceased may receive the payment. It cannot be paid to funeral homes, friends, or extended family members.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary class="faq-question">How do I apply for the Social Security death benefit?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Contact the Social Security Administration by calling 1-800-772-1213 or visiting your local SSA office. The funeral home may report the death, but you must separately apply for the lump-sum benefit. Have the deceased's Social Security number, a certified death certificate, and your own identification ready when you call.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary class="faq-question">What is the deadline to file for the death benefit?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>You must apply within two years of the date of death. If you miss this deadline, the $255 payment is permanently forfeited. There are no exceptions to this rule, so it is important to apply as soon as possible after the death.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary class="faq-question">Can the $255 payment go directly to the funeral home?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>No. The lump-sum death benefit is paid only to an eligible surviving spouse or dependent child. It cannot be paid directly to a funeral home, cemetery, or any other third party. Once you receive the payment, you may use it toward funeral expenses at your discretion.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary class="faq-question">Does the deceased need a certain number of work credits to qualify?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. The deceased generally needs 40 Social Security work credits (about 10 years of covered employment). However, younger workers who die before accumulating 40 credits may still qualify if they earned at least six credits in the three years before their death. Contact the SSA if you are unsure about the deceased's credit history.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary class="faq-question">Are there monthly survivor benefits in addition to the $255 payment?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. Surviving spouses, dependent children, and in some cases dependent parents may qualify for monthly survivor benefits based on the deceased's earnings record. These payments can be substantial, potentially hundreds or thousands of dollars per month. When you contact the SSA about the lump-sum benefit, ask about monthly survivor benefits at the same time.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary class="faq-question">What documents do I need to apply for the death benefit?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>You will typically need the deceased's Social Security number, a certified copy of the death certificate, the applicant's Social Security number, proof of marriage (if applying as a spouse), and bank account information for direct deposit. The SSA may request additional documents depending on your situation.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary class="faq-question">Why is the Social Security death benefit only $255?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The amount was set in 1954 and has never been adjusted for inflation. At the time, $255 was a meaningful contribution toward burial costs. In today's dollars, it would be equivalent to roughly $2,900. While there have been legislative proposals to increase the benefit over the years, none have been enacted into law.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary class="faq-question">Can I receive the death benefit if I was divorced from the deceased?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Generally, a divorced spouse is not eligible for the $255 lump-sum death benefit. However, a divorced surviving spouse may qualify for monthly survivor benefits if the marriage lasted at least 10 years and you are currently unmarried (or remarried after age 60). Contact the SSA to discuss your specific eligibility.</p>
