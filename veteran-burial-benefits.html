      <p class="guide-intro">
        The men and women who served our country deserve to be honored with dignity in death, just as they served with honor in life. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides a range of burial benefits designed to ease the financial burden on families and ensure that every eligible veteran receives a respectful farewell. This guide walks you through the benefits available, who qualifies, and how to apply &mdash; so you can focus on honoring the life and service of someone you love.
      </p>

      <!-- VA Burial Allowances -->
      <h2 id="burial-allowances">VA Burial Allowances</h2>

      <p>
        The VA offers monetary burial allowances to help offset funeral, burial, and transportation costs. The amount depends on whether the veteran's death was related to military service.
      </p>

      <h3>Service-Connected Death</h3>
      <p>
        If a veteran's death is the result of a service-connected disability, the VA may pay a burial allowance of <strong>$2,000 or more</strong> toward funeral and burial expenses. If the veteran is buried in a VA national cemetery, the VA may also reimburse some or all transportation costs for transporting the remains.
      </p>

      <h3>Non-Service-Connected Death</h3>
      <p>
        For deaths that are not related to military service, the VA may provide a <strong>burial allowance of up to $831</strong> and a <strong>separate plot allowance of up to $831</strong> if the veteran is not buried in a national cemetery. These figures are adjusted periodically by the VA to keep pace with rising costs. Veterans who were receiving VA pension or disability compensation at the time of death, or who died in a VA facility, typically qualify for these allowances.
      </p>

      <h3>How Amounts Are Determined</h3>
      <p>
        VA burial allowance amounts are set by Congress and adjusted annually. The specific amount a family receives depends on the circumstances of death, the veteran's benefits status, and where the burial takes place. Families should check <a href="https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/veterans-burial-allowance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VA.gov</a> for the most current rates, as they may change from year to year.
      </p>

      <!-- National Cemetery Burial -->
      <h2 id="national-cemetery">National Cemetery Burial</h2>

      <p>
        Burial in a VA national cemetery is available at <strong>no cost</strong> to eligible veterans and their families. There are more than 150 national cemeteries across the United States, each maintained with the care and reverence that our veterans deserve.
      </p>

      <h3>What Is Included at No Cost</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A gravesite in any national cemetery with available space</li>
        <li>Opening and closing of the grave</li>
        <li>A government-furnished headstone or marker</li>
        <li>A burial flag to drape the casket</li>
        <li>Perpetual care of the gravesite</li>
        <li>A Presidential Memorial Certificate</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Eligibility for National Cemetery Burial</h3>
      <p>
        Veterans who were discharged under conditions other than dishonorable are eligible, as are active-duty service members who die during service. Reservists and National Guard members who completed qualifying federal service also qualify. Spouses and dependent children of eligible veterans may be buried in a national cemetery as well, even if the veteran has already been laid to rest elsewhere.
      </p>

      <!-- Headstones, Markers, and Medallions -->
      <h2 id="headstones-markers">VA Headstones, Markers, and Medallions</h2>

      <p>
        The VA provides headstones, markers, and medallions at no cost to honor the memory of eligible veterans. These may be placed in national cemeteries, state veterans cemeteries, or private cemeteries.
      </p>

      <h3>Types Available</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Upright headstones</strong> &mdash; available in marble or granite</li>
        <li><strong>Flat markers</strong> &mdash; available in bronze, granite, or marble</li>
        <li><strong>Bronze niche markers</strong> &mdash; designed for placement in columbaria</li>
        <li><strong>Bronze medallions</strong> &mdash; designed to be attached to an existing privately purchased headstone, to signify veteran status</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Families can choose the inscription, including the veteran's name, branch of service, dates of birth and death, and an optional emblem of belief. To request a headstone or marker, submit <strong>VA Form 40-1330</strong> along with a copy of the veteran's discharge papers (DD-214).
      </p>

      <!-- Presidential Memorial Certificate -->
      <h2 id="memorial-certificate">Presidential Memorial Certificate</h2>

      <p>
        A Presidential Memorial Certificate (PMC) is a gold-embossed certificate bearing the signature of the current President. It is issued to honor the memory of veterans who were discharged under honorable conditions. This certificate is a meaningful keepsake that recognizes the veteran's service to our nation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eligible family members and loved ones can request the certificate by contacting the VA. Multiple copies can be provided at no charge, so that each family member may have one. Requests can be made through a VA regional office, online at VA.gov, or by calling the VA at <strong>1-800-827-1000</strong>.
      </p>

      <!-- Military Funeral Honors -->
      <h2 id="funeral-honors">Military Funeral Honors</h2>

      <p>
        Every eligible veteran is entitled to military funeral honors. The ceremony is a final tribute that acknowledges the veteran's faithful service and sacrifice.
      </p>

      <h3>What the Ceremony Includes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flag folding and presentation</strong> &mdash; The American flag is folded with precision and presented to the next of kin with the words, "On behalf of the President of the United States, the United States [branch of service], and a grateful nation, please accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your loved one's honorable and faithful service."</li>
        <li><strong>Playing of Taps</strong> &mdash; Performed by a bugler or played via a high-quality recording</li>
        <li><strong>Honor guard</strong> &mdash; At minimum, two uniformed service members. Full military honors for higher-ranking personnel may include a larger detail, a rifle salute, and a horse-drawn caisson.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Arrange Military Funeral Honors</h3>
      <p>
        Families should let their funeral director know that they would like military funeral honors. The funeral director will then coordinate with the appropriate military branch. You can also contact the branch of service directly or reach out to local veterans service organizations, such as the VFW or American Legion, who often provide volunteer honor guards.
      </p>

      <!-- Eligibility Requirements -->
      <h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility Requirements</h2>

      <p>
        Understanding who qualifies for VA burial benefits is important so that families can access every benefit to which they are entitled. Eligibility generally includes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Active-duty service members</strong> who die during active service</li>
        <li><strong>Veterans</strong> who were discharged under conditions other than dishonorable (including honorable, general, and under honorable conditions discharges)</li>
        <li><strong>Reservists and National Guard members</strong> who were entitled to retired pay, or who died while hospitalized or undergoing treatment at VA expense for a condition related to their service</li>
        <li><strong>Spouses and surviving spouses</strong> of eligible veterans, including those who remarried after age 55 (for burial in a national cemetery)</li>
        <li><strong>Minor children</strong> and, in certain circumstances, unmarried adult children who were dependent on the veteran</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you are unsure about eligibility, the VA can help. Call <strong>1-800-827-1000</strong> or visit your nearest VA regional office for a determination.
      </p>

      <!-- How to Apply -->
      <h2 id="how-to-apply">How to Apply for VA Burial Benefits</h2>

      <p>
        Applying for VA burial benefits is a straightforward process, but gathering the right documents in advance can help ensure a smooth experience during a difficult time.
      </p>

      <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Obtain the veteran's DD-214</strong> (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty). If you do not have a copy, you can request one from the National Personnel Records Center.</li>
        <li><strong>Complete VA Form 21P-530EZ</strong> (Application for Burial Benefits). This form is available online at VA.gov, at any VA regional office, or by calling the VA.</li>
        <li><strong>Gather supporting documents</strong>, including the veteran's death certificate, proof of military service, and itemized receipts for funeral and burial expenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Submit the application</strong> by mail, in person at a VA regional office, or online through the VA.gov portal.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Processing Timeline</h3>
      <p>
        The VA typically processes burial benefit claims within several weeks to a few months, depending on the complexity of the case and the completeness of the documentation provided. Submitting all required documents with your initial application helps avoid delays.
      </p>

      <!-- State Veteran Cemeteries -->
      <h2 id="state-cemeteries">State Veteran Cemeteries</h2>

      <p>
        In addition to the national cemeteries operated by the VA, many states operate their own veteran cemeteries. These state veteran cemeteries often have benefits similar to national cemeteries, including free burial for eligible veterans.
      </p>

      <p>
        State veteran cemeteries may be a good option if there is no national cemetery nearby, or if the family prefers a location closer to home. Some state cemeteries extend eligibility to a broader range of family members or offer additional services. Contact your state's department of veterans affairs to learn about specific benefits and availability in your area.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can find a state veteran cemetery near you through the <a href="https://www.va.gov/find-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VA facility locator</a> or by contacting your state's veterans affairs office.
      </p>

      <!-- Combining Benefits -->
      <h2 id="combining-benefits">Combining VA Benefits With Other Assistance</h2>

      <p>
        VA burial benefits can be received alongside other forms of financial assistance. Families are encouraged to explore every resource available so that the financial burden of saying goodbye does not add to the weight of grief.
      </p>

      <h3>Social Security Lump-Sum Death Payment</h3>
      <p>
        The Social Security Administration offers a one-time <a href="social-security-death-benefit.html">lump-sum death benefit of $255</a> to eligible surviving spouses or children. This payment is separate from VA benefits and can be claimed in addition to any VA burial allowance.
      </p>

      <h3>State and Local Programs</h3>
      <p>
        Many states offer their own veteran burial benefits, including additional allowances, free cemetery plots, or assistance with funeral costs through state veterans affairs offices. Some counties and municipalities also provide indigent burial assistance or emergency funeral funds. Checking with your local county social services office can uncover programs you might not know about.
      </p>

      <h3>Other Assistance</h3>
      <p>
        Families may also qualify for <a href="funeral-payment-assistance.html">funeral payment assistance</a> through nonprofit organizations, veterans service organizations like the VFW and American Legion, employer-sponsored benefits, or life insurance policies. Combining multiple sources of support can significantly reduce out-of-pocket costs.
