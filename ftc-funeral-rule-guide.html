The FTC has considered amendments over the years, including proposals to require funeral homes to post prices on their websites. As of 2026, the core provisions of the Rule remain in effect as originally established, though consumers and advocacy groups continue to push for modernization and expanded protections."

      <h1>The FTC Funeral Rule: A Complete Guide to Your Consumer Rights</h1>

      <p class="guide-intro">
        When someone you love dies, the last thing you should have to worry about is whether you are being treated fairly. Yet funeral arrangements involve significant financial decisions made during a time of profound emotional vulnerability &mdash; and not every family knows that federal law stands behind them. The Federal Trade Commission's Funeral Rule, codified at <strong>16 CFR Part 453</strong>, is one of the most important consumer protection regulations in the United States. It exists to ensure that every person arranging a funeral has access to clear pricing, honest information, and the freedom to choose only the goods and services they actually want. This guide explains every major provision of the Funeral Rule in plain language, so you can walk into any funeral home informed, empowered, and confident in your rights.

      <!-- Section 1 -->
      <h2 id="what-is-funeral-rule">What Is the FTC Funeral Rule?</h2>

      <p>
        The Funeral Rule is a federal trade regulation adopted by the Federal Trade Commission in <strong>1984</strong> under the authority of the FTC Act. Its official citation is 16 CFR Part 453, and it applies to all "funeral providers" &mdash; any person, partnership, or corporation that sells funeral goods or funeral services to the public. The Rule was created in response to decades of consumer complaints about deceptive and unfair practices in the funeral industry, including undisclosed pricing, high-pressure sales tactics, and false claims about legal requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the Funeral Rule took effect, families often had no way to compare funeral costs. Many funeral homes refused to provide written prices, quoted only package totals without itemization, and pressured grieving families into purchasing expensive goods and services they neither needed nor wanted. The FTC investigated these practices throughout the 1970s and concluded that industry-wide regulation was necessary to protect consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core purposes of the Funeral Rule are straightforward: require funeral homes to disclose pricing clearly and in writing, prohibit misrepresentations about what is legally required, and guarantee your right to purchase only the individual items you choose. The Rule is enforced by the FTC, which has the authority to investigate complaints, conduct compliance sweeps, and impose civil penalties on funeral homes that violate its provisions. Penalties for violations can reach <strong>tens of thousands of dollars per offense</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Funeral Rule applies in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. It sets a federal baseline of consumer protection &mdash; and many states have enacted additional regulations that go even further. Understanding both the federal Rule and your state's specific laws gives you the strongest possible foundation when making funeral arrangements.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 2 -->
      <h2 id="general-price-list">The General Price List: Your Most Important Tool</h2>

      <p>
        If there is one thing you take away from this guide, let it be this: <strong>always request the General Price List</strong>. The General Price List (GPL) is a written, itemized document that every funeral home in America is required to maintain and provide under 16 CFR 453.2(b)(4). It lists every good and service the funeral home offers, along with the price of each item. This is not optional or negotiable &mdash; it is federal law.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you visit a funeral home in person to discuss, arrange, or pre-arrange a funeral, the funeral provider must offer you the GPL <strong>before showing you any merchandise or beginning any discussion of services</strong>. You do not need to ask for it &mdash; they are required to hand it to you. You are entitled to keep this document. If a funeral home tries to take it back, refuses to provide it, or claims they do not have one, that is a serious violation of federal law.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GPL must include the following information at a minimum:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The name, address, and telephone number</strong> of the funeral provider.</li>
        <li><strong>A price for each item of service</strong> &mdash; not just packages or bundled totals, but the individual cost of each service offered, such as embalming, body preparation, use of facilities for viewing, use of facilities for a ceremony, hearse, limousine, and transfer of remains.</li>
        <li><strong>A price for each item of merchandise</strong> &mdash; including caskets, outer burial containers, and urns, with the price range available.</li>
        <li><strong>The non-declinable basic services fee</strong> &mdash; a clear statement of what this fee covers and how much it is.</li>
        <li><strong>Required disclosures</strong> about embalming, casket requirements for cremation, and the consumer's right to choose individual items.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can also request prices over the telephone. Under the Rule, when you call a funeral home and ask for pricing information, they must provide accurate prices for the items you inquire about. They cannot require you to visit in person before giving you this information. This provision is especially valuable when you are comparison shopping from home during a difficult time. We recommend requesting GPLs from at least two or three funeral homes before making any commitments &mdash; the differences in pricing can be dramatic. For a detailed look at every line item you may encounter, see our <a href="funeral-cost-breakdown.html">complete funeral cost breakdown guide</a>.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 3 -->
      <h2 id="individual-services">Your Right to Choose Individual Services</h2>

      <p>
        One of the most powerful protections in the Funeral Rule is the <strong>unbundling requirement</strong>. Under 16 CFR 453.2(b)(4)(ii), funeral homes must allow you to select individual goods and services &mdash; you cannot be forced to purchase a pre-set package as your only option. This means you have the legal right to build your own arrangement from the ground up, choosing only those items that are meaningful and necessary for your family's situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you want a simple graveside service without a viewing, you can decline to pay for embalming, a chapel ceremony, and the use of the funeral home's visitation room. If you want cremation without any formal services at the funeral home, you are entitled to purchase only the direct cremation package and nothing more. The funeral home may still offer packages &mdash; and some packages do provide genuine savings &mdash; but they cannot require you to purchase a bundle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only charge you typically cannot avoid is the <strong>non-declinable basic services fee</strong>. This fee covers the funeral home's overhead and administrative costs, such as staff time, facility maintenance, regulatory compliance, and filing death certificates and permits. It is added to every arrangement and can range from <strong>$1,500 to $3,500 or more</strong>, varying significantly between providers. Because this fee is non-negotiable, comparing it across several funeral homes is one of the most impactful things you can do to manage your total costs.

        The Funeral Rule also requires that, after you have selected your goods and services, the funeral home must provide you with an <strong>itemized Statement of Funeral Goods and Services Selected</strong> before any services are performed. This written statement must list every item you have chosen and its price, the total cost, and any legal, cemetery, or crematory requirements that affect your choices. Review this document carefully before signing &mdash; it is your contract and your protection.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 4 -->
      <h2 id="casket-rights">Casket and Container Rights</h2>

      <p>
        Caskets are often the single most expensive item in a funeral arrangement, with funeral home prices commonly ranging from <strong>$2,000 to $10,000</strong> or more. The Funeral Rule provides critical protections in this area that can save your family thousands of dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Third-party caskets.</strong> Under the Funeral Rule, you have an absolute right to purchase a casket from any source you choose &mdash; an online retailer, a wholesale club like Costco or Walmart, an independent casket dealer, or even a local woodworker. The funeral home must accept this casket and <strong>cannot charge you any handling fee, surcharge, or penalty</strong> for using it. This prohibition is explicit in the Rule and is one of its most consumer-friendly provisions. Caskets purchased outside the funeral home are often identical in quality and construction but can cost 50% less or more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Alternative containers for cremation.</strong> If you choose cremation, you are not required to purchase a casket. Most crematories require only a <strong>rigid, combustible enclosure</strong>, and the Funeral Rule requires funeral homes to make an alternative container available. Alternative containers are simple enclosures made of unfinished wood, pressed wood, or heavy cardboard, and they typically cost between <strong>$50 and $200</strong> &mdash; a fraction of what a casket costs. The funeral home must inform you of this option and include it on their price list.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rental caskets.</strong> Many funeral homes also offer rental caskets for viewing purposes. A rental casket provides the appearance of a traditional casket for a ceremony or viewing, with a removable interior liner that is replaced between uses. After the service, the body is transferred to a simpler container for cremation or burial. This can be a meaningful option for families who want a traditional viewing at a substantially lower cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Outer burial containers.</strong> The Funeral Rule also requires funeral homes to disclose that, in most states, no law requires the use of an outer burial container (vault or grave liner) for burial. However, many cemeteries do require them as part of their own policies. The GPL must clearly state that an outer burial container is not required by state law, and the funeral home must tell you if the cemetery you are using has its own requirement.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 5 -->
      <h2 id="embalming-disclosures">Embalming Disclosures</h2>

      <p>
        Embalming is perhaps the area where the Funeral Rule has its most direct impact on preventing misinformation. Many families believe that embalming is legally required after a death. <strong>It is not.</strong> No state universally requires embalming for all deaths, and the Funeral Rule specifically prohibits funeral providers from telling you otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the Rule, funeral homes must include a disclosure on the General Price List that reads substantially as follows: "Except in certain special cases, embalming is not required by law. Embalming may be necessary, however, if you select certain funeral arrangements, such as a funeral with viewing. If you do not want embalming, you usually have the right to choose an arrangement that does not require you to pay for it, such as direct cremation or immediate burial."
      </p>
      <p>
        The Rule also prohibits funeral homes from <strong>embalming the body without your express authorization</strong> and then charging you for it. If a funeral home embalms without your consent, they cannot add that charge to your bill. This protection ensures that families are not pressured into paying for a service they never requested.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are limited circumstances where embalming may be required &mdash; for example, when a body is being transported across certain state lines by common carrier, or when local regulations require it for bodies that will not be buried or cremated within a specific timeframe. These situations vary by state. Refrigeration is a widely accepted and less expensive alternative to embalming, typically costing <strong>$100 to $300 per day</strong> compared to $500 to $900 or more for embalming. If a funeral home claims embalming is required for your situation, ask them to cite the specific statute. For more on this topic, see our guide on <a href="what-funeral-homes-dont-tell-you.html">what funeral homes don't always tell you</a>.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 6 -->
      <h2 id="required-disclosures">Required Disclosures Funeral Homes Must Make</h2>

      <p>
        Beyond the General Price List, the Funeral Rule imposes several specific disclosure requirements on funeral providers. Understanding these requirements helps you recognize when a funeral home is complying with the law &mdash; and when it is not.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Embalming disclosure.</strong> As noted above, the GPL must state that embalming is generally not required by law and that families have the right to choose arrangements that do not include embalming.</li>
        <li><strong>Casket-for-cremation disclosure.</strong> The GPL must include a statement that you do not need to buy a casket for direct cremation, and the funeral home must describe the alternative containers available and their prices.</li>
        <li><strong>Outer burial container disclosure.</strong> The GPL must state that state law does not require an outer burial container in most jurisdictions, though individual cemeteries may have their own requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash advance items.</strong> When the funeral home arranges third-party goods and services on your behalf &mdash; such as flowers, obituary notices, death certificates, or clergy honorariums &mdash; the Rule requires them to disclose in writing on the Statement of Goods and Services whether these items are being billed at cost or whether a service charge or markup is added.</li>
        <li><strong>Telephone price disclosure.</strong> Funeral homes must provide accurate price information to anyone who calls and asks, for any individual item. They cannot refuse to give phone prices or require an in-person visit first.</li>
        <li><strong>Statement of Funeral Goods and Services Selected.</strong> Before the funeral begins, the provider must give you a written, itemized statement listing everything you have chosen, its price, and the total. This document must also reference any legal, cemetery, or crematory requirements that necessitate specific purchases.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These disclosures are designed to ensure that you always have complete, accurate information before making financial commitments. A funeral home that operates transparently will provide these disclosures without hesitation.

      </p>

      <!-- Section 7 -->
      <h2 id="not-covered">What the Funeral Rule Does NOT Cover</h2>

      <p>
        While the Funeral Rule is a powerful consumer protection tool, it does have limitations. Understanding what the Rule does <strong>not</strong> cover helps you know where to look for additional protections.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cemeteries.</strong> The Funeral Rule applies only to funeral providers &mdash; businesses that sell funeral goods and services directly to the public. It does <strong>not</strong> apply to cemeteries, even though cemeteries sell burial plots, outer burial containers, headstones, and markers. Cemetery pricing practices are generally regulated at the state level. If you have a dispute with a cemetery, contact your state's cemetery regulatory board or attorney general's office.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Crematories.</strong> Stand-alone crematories that do not also function as funeral homes are not covered by the Funeral Rule. However, if a funeral home operates its own crematory or contracts with one on your behalf, the funeral home's charges are still subject to the Rule's pricing and disclosure requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Third-party sellers of funeral goods.</strong> Online casket retailers, memorial product companies, and other third-party vendors are not covered by the Funeral Rule. While these sellers may offer significant savings, they are not required to follow the Rule's disclosure requirements. Your recourse with these sellers is through general consumer protection laws and your state's attorney general.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pre-need arrangements.</strong> The Funeral Rule primarily addresses "at-need" funeral arrangements &mdash; those made at or around the time of death. Pre-need (or pre-planned) funeral contracts are largely regulated by state law, not the Funeral Rule. If you are considering a <a href="prepaid-funeral-plans.html">prepaid funeral plan</a>, make sure to research your state's specific consumer protections for prepaid contracts, including how funds are held, whether they are refundable, and what happens if the funeral home goes out of business.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Price gouging or fairness.</strong> The Funeral Rule does not regulate how much a funeral home can charge for its goods and services. It requires transparency and honesty, but it does not set price caps or determine what constitutes a "fair" price. Comparison shopping remains your best tool for finding reasonable pricing in your area.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 8 -->
      <h2 id="common-violations">Common Violations and How to Spot Them</h2>

      <p>
        The FTC conducts periodic undercover compliance investigations of funeral homes across the country. These sweeps have consistently found that a significant percentage of funeral homes fail to comply fully with the Funeral Rule. Knowing what violations look like helps you protect yourself in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Refusing to provide the General Price List.</strong> This is the most fundamental violation. If a funeral home will not give you a written, itemized price list when you visit or refuses to provide prices over the phone, they are breaking federal law. Some homes may hand you a brochure or summary instead of the actual GPL &mdash; this does not satisfy the requirement. You are entitled to the complete, itemized list.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Claiming embalming is always required.</strong> Any funeral provider that tells you embalming is universally required by law is making a misrepresentation prohibited by the Funeral Rule. While embalming may be required in narrow, specific circumstances, a blanket claim is never accurate. Ask for the citation to the specific law they are referencing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Requiring a casket for cremation.</strong> Some funeral homes may insist that you must purchase a casket before cremation. This is false. The Rule requires funeral homes to offer an alternative container for cremation and to inform you of this option. If a funeral home pushes only casket options for cremation, they are likely in violation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Charging handling fees for third-party caskets.</strong> If a funeral home adds a surcharge, service fee, or handling fee because you purchased your casket elsewhere, this is a direct violation of the Funeral Rule. The prohibition is unambiguous.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bundling services without offering itemized alternatives.</strong> If the only options presented to you are pre-built packages with no ability to select individual items, the funeral home is not complying with the unbundling requirement. You always have the right to choose services a la carte.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Embalming without authorization.</strong> If a funeral home embalms the body before receiving your explicit consent and then charges you for it, they have violated the Rule. You are under no obligation to pay for unauthorized embalming.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Misrepresenting legal requirements.</strong> Any false claim about what the law requires &mdash; such as stating that an outer burial container is legally mandated, that a specific casket is required for a viewing, or that certain services cannot be declined &mdash; is a violation of the Funeral Rule's prohibition against misrepresentations.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 9 -->
      <h2 id="file-complaint">How to File a Complaint</h2>

      <p>
        If you believe a funeral home has violated the Funeral Rule, you have several avenues for reporting the violation and seeking resolution. Filing a complaint helps protect not only yourself but also other families who may encounter the same practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Federal Trade Commission.</strong> The FTC is the primary enforcement agency for the Funeral Rule. You can file a complaint online at <strong>ftc.gov/complaint</strong> or by calling <strong>1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357)</strong>. When filing, provide as much detail as possible: the name and location of the funeral home, the date of your interaction, what happened, and any documents you have (contracts, price lists, receipts, written communications). The FTC uses complaints to identify patterns and target enforcement actions, and individual complaints may trigger an investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>State attorney general.</strong> Every state has an attorney general's office with a consumer protection division. Many state AGs have dedicated programs for funeral industry complaints. You can typically file online through your state AG's website. State-level complaints can lead to enforcement actions, fines, and in some cases, restitution for affected consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>State funeral licensing board.</strong> Most states have a board or commission that licenses and regulates funeral directors and funeral establishments. These boards can investigate complaints, conduct inspections, issue citations, suspend or revoke licenses, and order corrective action. Filing with your state board is especially effective for operational violations, as the board has direct authority over the funeral home's ability to continue doing business.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Document everything.</strong> Whatever avenue you choose, thorough documentation strengthens your complaint. Keep copies of the General Price List, the Statement of Funeral Goods and Services Selected, any contracts you signed, receipts for all payments, written correspondence (including emails and text messages), and notes about any verbal conversations &mdash; including dates, times, and the names of people you spoke with. If possible, bring a trusted friend or family member to arrangement meetings so you have a witness to what was said and offered.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 10 -->
      <h2 id="action-plan">Protecting Yourself: A Consumer Action Plan</h2>

      <p>
        Knowledge is your most powerful tool when navigating funeral arrangements. The following step-by-step checklist is designed to help you exercise your rights confidently, whether you are making arrangements during a time of loss or planning ahead for the future.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Request the General Price List immediately.</strong> Before discussing any services, ask for the GPL. If the funeral home hesitates, consider it a warning sign. You are entitled to this document by federal law, and you may take it home.</li>
        <li><strong>Gather GPLs from at least two or three funeral homes.</strong> Prices for the same services can vary by thousands of dollars between providers in the same city. A few phone calls can save your family a significant amount of money. Use our <a href="funeral-costs-by-state.html">funeral costs by state</a> guide for regional context.</li>
        <li><strong>Compare the basic services fee first.</strong> This non-declinable charge varies the most between providers and directly impacts your total cost. A funeral home with a $1,800 basic services fee may offer the same quality of care as one charging $3,500.</li>
        <li><strong>Select services individually.</strong> Review the GPL and choose only the items your family wants and needs. Do not accept a package without first comparing it to the sum of individual items. Ask: "Can I build my own arrangement from individual line items?"</li>
        <li><strong>Ask about embalming before it happens.</strong> Unless you specifically want embalming, state clearly that you do not authorize it. Ask about refrigeration as an alternative. If the funeral home claims embalming is required, ask them to cite the specific law.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider purchasing your casket independently.</strong> Research casket prices from online retailers and local suppliers before visiting the funeral home. If you find a casket you prefer from an outside source, the funeral home must accept it without any additional charge.</li>
        <li><strong>Request a written Statement of Goods and Services Selected.</strong> Before any work begins, review the itemized statement carefully. Make sure every charge is listed, understood, and authorized. Do not sign anything until you are satisfied.</li>
        <li><strong>Bring a trusted companion.</strong> A calm, clear-headed friend or family member can help you process information, ask questions, and resist pressure. Two sets of ears are invaluable during emotional conversations.</li>
        <li><strong>Know your state-specific rights.</strong> Many states provide protections beyond the federal Funeral Rule. Research your state's funeral and burial regulations, including rules about home funerals, embalming, and cemetery practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Report violations promptly.</strong> If you experience unfair treatment, undisclosed pricing, or misrepresentations, file complaints with the FTC, your state attorney general, and your state funeral licensing board. Your report protects future families.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Making funeral arrangements is one of the most difficult tasks any family faces. It is made even harder when you are unsure of your rights. The Funeral Rule exists precisely because families deserve honesty, transparency, and fairness during one of life's most vulnerable moments. You are not being disrespectful by asking for a price list. You are not being cheap by comparing costs. You are being a responsible, loving advocate for your family &mdash; and the law is on your side.

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">What is the FTC Funeral Rule?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The FTC Funeral Rule is a federal regulation (16 CFR Part 453) enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. It requires funeral homes to provide itemized pricing through a General Price List, prohibits misrepresentations about what the law requires, and guarantees your right to select only the goods and services you want. The Rule has been in effect since 1984 and applies to all funeral providers in the United States.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Can a funeral home refuse to give me a price list?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>No. Under the Funeral Rule, every funeral provider must offer you a written General Price List when you visit in person, and must give you accurate prices over the telephone when you call. Refusal to provide the GPL is a direct violation of federal law. If you encounter this, it is a serious red flag &mdash; you should report the business to the FTC and your state attorney general.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Do I have to buy a casket from the funeral home?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>No. The Funeral Rule explicitly protects your right to purchase a casket from any source &mdash; online retailers, warehouse clubs, independent dealers, or local craftspeople. The funeral home must accept the casket without charging any handling fee, surcharge, or penalty. Many families save hundreds or even thousands of dollars by shopping for caskets outside the funeral home.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Is embalming required by law?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>In most situations, no. No state universally requires embalming for all deaths. The Funeral Rule prohibits funeral providers from claiming that embalming is legally required when it is not. Embalming may be needed in specific circumstances &mdash; such as certain interstate transportation or extended delays before burial &mdash; but refrigeration is a widely accepted and less expensive alternative in most cases.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Can funeral homes charge a fee for using an outside casket?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>No. The Funeral Rule expressly prohibits funeral homes from imposing a handling fee, service charge, or any other financial penalty for using a casket purchased from a third party. If a funeral home attempts to charge you extra for bringing your own casket, they are in violation of federal law and you should report them to the FTC.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Does the Funeral Rule apply to cemeteries?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>No. The Funeral Rule applies only to funeral providers &mdash; businesses that sell funeral goods and services to the public. Cemeteries, stand-alone crematories, and third-party sellers of memorial products are not covered by the Rule. Cemetery pricing and practices are generally regulated at the state level. If you have a complaint about a cemetery, contact your state's cemetery regulatory board or attorney general.</p>

        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">What should I do if a funeral home violates the Rule?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Document the violation as thoroughly as possible, including dates, names, and copies of any relevant documents. Then file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at ftc.gov/complaint, contact your state attorney general's consumer protection division, and report the issue to your state funeral licensing board. Each of these agencies has the authority to investigate and take action against the funeral home.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Can I get prices over the phone?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. The Funeral Rule requires funeral providers to give accurate price information over the telephone to anyone who calls and asks. They must provide the price of any individual item you inquire about and cannot require you to visit in person before sharing pricing. This makes it possible to compare costs across multiple providers from the comfort of your home during an incredibly difficult time.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">What is the basic services fee?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The basic services fee is a non-declinable charge included in every funeral arrangement. It covers the funeral home's overhead costs, including staff availability, facility maintenance, licensing, and administrative work such as filing death certificates and obtaining permits. This fee typically ranges from $1,500 to $3,500 or more and varies significantly between providers. Comparing this single line item across funeral homes is one of the most effective strategies for managing your total cost.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Has the FTC Funeral Rule been updated recently?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The Funeral Rule was originally enacted in 1984, and the FTC has conducted periodic regulatory reviews since then. In recent years, consumer advocates and some FTC commissioners have proposed updates, including requiring funeral homes to post their prices online and extending the Rule's protections to cemeteries and crematories. As of 2026, the core provisions of the Rule remain in effect as originally adopted, though the conversation about modernization continues.</p>
