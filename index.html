            <strong>First, our deepest, heartfelt condolences.</strong>
            We know this week is overwhelming. That’s why we built this site — to gently help you find fair,
            reasonable pricing and the right accommodations so you can focus on honoring a life well lived.

          In minutes, you’ll see realistic local costs for services, understand what usually drives prices up or down,
          and explore ideas families often use to keep things respectful without overspending. Everything here is
          written to be as clear and human as possible, with a calm tone that respects your grief.

      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        We are a small team of researchers, writers, and technologists who have each walked through the loss of someone
        we love. We know how confusing it can feel to juggle grief, logistics, and costs at the same time. This site and
        the AI helper are designed to give you a gentler starting point — a place to read, think, and ask questions
        without sales pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are <strong>not</strong> funeral directors, lawyers, or financial advisors. We do not sell plans or services.
        Instead, we focus on explaining common terms, typical cost ranges, and questions you can bring to licensed
        professionals, funeral homes, and advisors in your area.

      <p>
        Use this simple estimator to get a rough idea of how different choices can add up. This is only an
        educational tool — it is not a quote, not a contract, and not professional advice. Always confirm real prices
        directly with funeral homes, cemeteries, and other providers.

        Every family’s needs are different, but many budgets start with a similar checklist of decisions. Use the
        checklist below as a thinking guide — it is not a formal quote, but it can help you estimate which choices
        tend to be higher or lower cost so you can talk with local providers.
      </p>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Type of service (traditional funeral, memorial only, direct cremation, or direct burial).</li>
        <li>Location and venue (funeral home chapel, house of worship, community hall, graveside-only).</li>
        <li>Preparation and care of the body (embalming, dressing, basic care, or minimal preparation).</li>
        <li>Casket or urn choices and whether rental or simple options are acceptable.</li>
        <li>Burial plot, niche, or scattering location, plus any cemetery fees or opening/closing charges.</li>
        <li>Transportation for the deceased and for family members if needed.</li>
        <li>Printing, flowers, music, livestreaming, and other optional extras.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small muted">
        The AI helper can walk through this checklist with you step by step, helping you organize your thoughts
        before you speak with a funeral home or cemetery.

    <section id="payment-help" class="section card">
      <h2>Payment ideas families often explore</h2>
      <p>
        Many families are surprised by how quickly funeral and burial costs add up. The goal of this section is to help
        you understand common paths people research — not to tell you what to do or whether you qualify for any option.
      </p>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Existing life insurance policies and whether they can be assigned to the funeral home.</li>
        <li>Payable-on-death bank accounts or small savings earmarked for final expenses.</li>
        <li>Short-term payment plans with funeral homes or third-party financing companies.</li>
        <li>Veterans benefits, union benefits, or employer-sponsored assistance where available.</li>
        <li>State or county assistance for indigent burials or hardship situations.</li>
        <li>Community support such as faith communities, mutual aid, or fundraising among friends and family.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small muted">
        The AI helper can suggest questions to ask about each of these ideas. It cannot tell you what you personally
        qualify for or whether a specific product is right for you. Those decisions must be made with licensed
        professionals who understand your situation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="state-costs" class="section card">
      <h2>Researching costs by state</h2>
      <p>
        Average funeral and burial expenses vary widely by state and even by county. Some states have strong consumer
        protection rules, price disclosure requirements, or public guides that outline typical fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask the AI helper to walk you through how to search for state-specific consumer guides, funeral board websites,
        and local price surveys. It can also help you create a simple script for calling multiple funeral homes so you
        feel more confident asking for itemized price lists.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ai-helper" class="section section-highlight">
      <h2>Talk with the AI funeral cost helper</h2>
      <p>
        When you’re ready, you can open the AI helper for a calm, private conversation about what you’re facing. You
        can type things like:
      </p>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>“We were quoted $9,000 for a funeral. What questions should I ask before agreeing?”</li>
        <li>“Can you help me think through a simple, respectful service on a limited budget?”</li>
        <li>“How do people usually compare prices between funeral homes without feeling rude?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small muted">
        The AI cannot give you legal, financial, tax, or medical advice. It cannot tell you what to sign or what you
        should personally choose. It exists to help you slow down, organize your thoughts, and prepare for conversations
        with licensed funeral directors, attorneys, and financial professionals.
