          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              According to the National Funeral Directors Association, the median cost of a funeral with viewing and
              burial is approximately $7,848, while a funeral with cremation averages around $6,971. However, costs
              vary widely by state, provider, and the services chosen. Some families spend under $2,000 with direct
              cremation, while others spend $15,000 or more for elaborate services. The best way to understand costs
              in your area is to request itemized price lists from several local funeral homes — they are required by
              federal law to provide them.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              A traditional funeral typically includes embalming, a viewing or visitation, a formal ceremony (often at a
              funeral home chapel or house of worship), and burial in a casket. Direct cremation skips the viewing and
              formal ceremony entirely — the body is cremated shortly after death, and the family may hold a memorial
              service later if they wish. Direct cremation is usually the least expensive option and is growing in
              popularity across the country.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No. Under the FTC Funeral Rule, funeral homes must accept caskets purchased from third-party retailers
              (including online sellers) without charging a handling fee. This can sometimes save families hundreds or
              thousands of dollars. It's worth comparing prices before making a decision.

          <summary class="faq-question">What is the FTC Funeral Rule?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The FTC Funeral Rule is a federal regulation enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. It requires funeral
              providers to give you itemized price lists (called a General Price List, or GPL) when you ask. It allows
              you to choose only the goods and services you want, without being forced into package deals. It also
              prohibits funeral homes from making false claims about legal requirements — for example, they cannot tell
              you that embalming is required by law when it isn't (in most states). If you believe a funeral home has
              violated the Funeral Rule, you can file a complaint with the FTC.

          <summary class="faq-question">Is embalming legally required?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              In most states, embalming is not required by law. It is typically optional, though funeral homes may
              require it for certain services such as an open-casket viewing. Alternatives include refrigeration or
              dry ice. If you're told embalming is mandatory, ask for the specific law or regulation — in most cases,
              it is a funeral home policy, not a legal requirement.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              In many states, families have the legal right to handle some or all funeral arrangements themselves,
              including transporting the body, preparing it for burial or cremation, and holding a ceremony. This is
              sometimes called a "home funeral" or "family-directed funeral." However, the laws vary by state, and some
              states require a licensed funeral director for certain steps. Research your state's laws or consult your
              state's funeral board before making arrangements independently.

      <h2>Researching costs by state</h2>
      <p>
        Average funeral and burial expenses vary widely by state and even by county. Some states have strong consumer
        protection rules, price disclosure requirements, or public guides that outline typical fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask the AI helper to walk you through how to search for state-specific consumer guides, funeral board websites,
        and local price surveys. It can also help you create a simple script for calling multiple funeral homes so you
        feel more confident asking for itemized price lists.
      </p>
      <div class="tip-box">
        <h3>Quick research tip</h3>
        <p>
          Search for <em>"[your state] funeral board consumer guide"</em> or <em>"[your state] funeral price survey"</em>
          to find official resources. Many state attorneys general also publish guides on funeral consumer rights.
