      <h2>Understanding Chicago Funeral Pricing</h2>
      <p>Funeral costs in Chicago carry a metro premium of approximately 20% above the Illinois state average. This is driven by higher real estate costs for funeral home facilities, higher labor costs, and greater demand for services in a dense metropolitan area. However, the competitive market in Chicago also means you have more providers to choose from, which gives you leverage when comparing prices.</p>
      <p>The most effective way to find the best price is to request General Price Lists from 2 to 3 funeral homes in the Chicago area and compare them line by line. Under the FTC Funeral Rule, every provider must give you this list upon request — no appointment needed, no commitment required.</p>
